## 9.1.3
  - Improve plugin behavior when Elasticsearch is down on startup #758

## 9.1.2
  - No user facing changes, removed unnecessary test dep.

## 9.1.1
  - Docs: Set the default_codec doc attribute.

## 9.1.0
  - Set number_of_shards to 1 and document_type to '_doc' for es 7.x clusters #741 #747

## 9.0.3
  - Ignore master-only nodes when using sniffing

## 9.0.2
  - Ignore event's type field for the purpose of setting document `_type` if cluster is es 6.x or above

## 9.0.1
  - Update gemspec summary

### 9.0.0
  - Change default document type to 'doc' from 'logs' to align with beats and reflect the generic nature of logstash.
  - Deprecate 'document_type' option

### 8.2.2
  - Use `#response_body` instead of `#body` when debugging response from the server #679

## 8.2.1
  - Docs: Add DLQ policy section

## 8.2.0
  - Improved Elasticsearch version handling
  - Improved event error logging when DLQ is disabled in Logstash

## 8.1.1
  - Retry all non-200 responses of the bulk API indefinitely
  - Improve documentation on retry codes

## 8.1.0
  - Support Elasticsearch 6.x join field type
## 8.0.2
  - Fix bug where logging errors for bad response codes would raise an unhandled exception

## 8.0.1
  - Fix some documentation issues

## 8.0.0
 - Breaking: make deprecated options :flush_size and :idle_flush_time obsolete
 - Remove obsolete options :max_retries and :retry_max_items
 - Fix: handling of initial single big event
 - Fix: typo was enabling http compression by default this returns it back to false

## 7.3.7
 - Properly support characters needing escaping in users / passwords across multiple SafeURI implementions (pre/post LS 5.5.1)
 - Logstash 5.5.0 does NOT work with this release as it has a broken SafeURI implementation

## 7.3.6
 - Bump for doc gen

## 7.3.5
 - Fix incorrect variable reference when DLQing events

## 7.3.4
 - Fix incorrect handling of bulk_path containing ?s

## 7.3.3

 - Wait for all inflight requests to complete before stopping

## 7.3.1
 - Fix the backwards compatibility layer used for detecting DLQ capabilities in logstash core

## 7.3.0
 - Log 429 errors as debug instead of error. These aren't actual errors and cause users undue concern.
   This status code is triggered when ES wants LS to backoff, which it does correctly (exponentially)

## 7.2.2
 - Docs: Add requirement to use version 6.2.5 or higher to support sending Content-Type headers.

## 7.2.1
 - Expose a `#post` method in the http client class to be use by other modules

## 7.2.0
 - Support 6.0.0-alpha1 version of Elasticsearch by adding a separate 6x template
 - Note: This version is backwards compatible w.r.t. config, but for ES 6.0.0, `_all` has been
    removed. This BWC issue only affects ES version 6.x; older versions
    can be used with this plugin as is.

## 7.1.0
 - Add support to compress requests using the new `http_compression` option.

## 7.0.0
- introduce customization of bulk, healthcheck and sniffing paths with the behaviour:
  - if not set: the default value will be used
  - if not set and path is also set: the default is appended to path
  - if set: the set value will be used, ignoring the default and path setting
- removes absolute_healthcheck_path and query_parameters

## 6.2.6
- Fixed: Change how the healthcheck_path is treated: either append it to any existing path (default) or replace any existing path
  Also ensures that the healthcheck url contains no query parameters regarless of hosts urls contains them or query_params being set. #554

## 6.2.5
- Send the Content-Type: application/json header that proper ES clients should send

## 6.2.4
- Fix bug where using escaped characters in the password field would attempt to show a warning but instead crash.
  The warning was also not necessary since escaped characters never worked there before.

## 6.2.3
- Fixed a bug introduced in 6.2.2 where passwords needing escapes were not actually sent to ES properly
  encoded. 

## 6.2.2
- Fixed a bug that forced users to URL encode the `password` option.
  If you are currently manually escaping your passwords upgrading to this version
  will break authentication. You should unescape your password if you have implemented
  this workaround as it will otherwise be doubly encoded.
  URL escaping is STILL required for passwords inline with URLs in the `hosts` option. 

## 6.2.1
- When an HTTP error is encountered, log the response body instead of the request.
  The request body will still be logged at debug level.

## 6.2.0
- Add version number / version conflict support

## 6.1.0
- Add option to use an absolute healthcheck path

## 6.0.0
- Proxies requiring auth now always work when a URL is specified
- It is no longer possible to specify a proxy as a hash due to security reasons 
- Fix URL normalization logic to correctly apply all settings to sniffed hosts
- Proxies requiring auth now always work when a URL is specified
- Switch internals to new LogStash::Util::SafeURI type for more defensive approach to logging credentials

## 5.4.1
- Correctly sniff against ES 5.x clusters

## 5.4.0
- Perform healthcheck against hosts right after startup / sniffing
- Add support for custom query parameters

## 5.3.5
- Docs: Remove mention of using the elasticsearch_java output plugin because it is no longer supported

## 5.3.4
- Add `sprintf` or event dependent configuration when specifying ingest pipeline

## 5.3.3
- Hide user/password in connection pool

## 5.3.2
- Use byte size, not char count for bulk operation size checks

## 5.3.1
- depends on Adressable ~> 2.3.0 to satisfy development dependency of the core ([logstash/#6204](https://github.com/elastic/logstash/issues/6204))

## 5.3.0
- Bulk operations will now target 20MB chunks at a time to reduce heap usage

## 5.2.0
- Change default lang for scripts to be painless, inline with ES 5.0. Earlier there was no default.

## 5.1.2
- Hide credentials in exceptions and log messages ([#482](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch/issues/482))
- [internal] Remove dependency on longshoreman project

## 5.1.1
- Hide user and password from the URL logged during sniffing process.

## 5.1.0
- Add check_connection_timeout parameter (default 10m)
- Set default timeout to 60s

## 5.0.0
- Breaking Change: Index template for 5.0 has been changed to reflect Elasticsearch's mapping changes. Most importantly,
the subfield for string multi-fields has changed from `.raw` to `.keyword` to match ES default behavior. ([#386](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch/issues/386))

**Users installing ES 5.x and LS 5.x**
This change will not affect you and you will continue to use the ES defaults.

**Users upgrading from LS 2.x to LS 5.x with ES 5.x**
LS will not force upgrade the template, if `logstash` template already exists. This means you will still use
`.raw` for sub-fields coming from 2.x. If you choose to use the new template, you will have to reindex your data after
the new template is installed.

## 4.1.3
- Relax constraint on logstash-core-plugin-api to >= 1.60 <= 2.99

## 4.1.2

- Added a configuration called failure_type_logging_whitelist which takes a list of strings, that are error types from elasticsearch, so we prevent logging WARN if elasticsearch fails with that action. See https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch/issues/423
