## 6.0.0

- Fix URL normalization logic to correctly apply all settings to sniffed hosts
- Proxies requiring auth now always work when a URL is specified

## 5.4.1

- Add support for custom query parameters

## 5.3.5

## 5.3.3
- Hide user/password in connection pool

## 5.3.2
- Use byte size, not char count for bulk operation size checks

## 5.3.1
- depends on Adressable ~> 2.3.0 to satisfy development dependency of the core ([logstash/#6204](https://github.com/elastic/logstash/issues/6204))

## 5.3.0
- Bulk operations will now target 20MB chunks at a time to reduce heap usage

## 5.2.0
- Change default lang for scripts to be painless, inline with ES 5.0. Earlier there was no default.

## 5.1.2

## 5.1.1

## 5.1.0
- Add check_connection_timeout parameter (default 10m)
- Set default timeout to 60s

## 5.0.0
- Breaking Change: Index template for 5.0 has been changed to reflect Elasticsearch's mapping changes. Most importantly,
the subfield for string multi-fields has changed from `.raw` to `.keyword` to match ES default behavior. ([#386](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-output-elasticsearch/issues/386))

**Users installing ES 5.x and LS 5.x**
This change will not affect you and you will continue to use the ES defaults.

**Users upgrading from LS 2.x to LS 5.x with ES 5.x**
LS will not force upgrade the template, if `logstash` template already exists. This means you will still use
`.raw` for sub-fields coming from 2.x. If you choose to use the new template, you will have to reindex your data after
the new template is installed.
