# This output lets you store logs in Elasticsearch and is the most recommended
# output for Logstash. If you plan on using the Kibana web interface, you'll
# want to use this output.
#
# This output only speaks the HTTP, which is the preferred protocol for interacting with Elasticsearch. By default
# Elasticsearch exposes HTTP on port 9200.
#
# We strongly encourage the use of HTTP over the node protocol. It is just as
# fast and far easier to administer. For those wishing to use the java protocol please see the 'elasticsearch_java' gem.
#
# You can learn more about Elasticsearch at <https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch>
#
# ==== Retry Policy
#
# By default all bulk requests to ES are synchronous. Not all events in the bulk requests
# always make it successfully. For example, there could be events which are not formatted
# correctly for the index they are targeting (type mismatch in mapping). So that we minimize loss of 
# events, we have a specific retry policy in place. We retry all events which fail to be reached by 
# Elasticsearch for network related issues. We retry specific events which exhibit errors under a separate 
# policy described below. Events of this nature are ones which experience ES error codes described as 
# retryable errors.
#
# *Retryable Errors:*
#
# - 429, Too Many Requests (RFC6585)
# - 503, The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary overloading or maintenance of the server.
# 
# Here are the rules of what is retried when:
#
# - Block and retry all events in bulk response that experiences transient network exceptions until
#   a successful submission is received by Elasticsearch.
# - Retry subset of sent events which resulted in ES errors of a retryable nature which can be found 
#   in RETRYABLE_CODES
# - For events which returned retryable error codes, they will be pushed onto a separate queue for 
#   retrying events. events in this queue will be retried a maximum of 5 times by default (configurable through :max_retries). The size of 
#   this queue is capped by the value set in :retry_max_items.
# - Events from the retry queue are submitted again either when the queue reaches its max size or when
#   the max interval time is reached, which is set in :retry_max_interval.
# - Events which are not retryable or have reached their max retry count are logged to stderr.

  #
  # - index: indexes a document (an event from Logstash).
  # - delete: deletes a document by id
